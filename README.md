In this repository I will maintain curated list of Machine learning resources. 

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning 

[This](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) famous online book by Michael Nielson, is nice to get some intial knowledge and background.

[This](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/The-9-Deep-Learning-Papers-You-Need-To-Know-About.html) blog post are more simpler to understand than the above book, in my opinion. In the 3rd part, he also discusses some papers showing recent development in Convolutional Neural Networks.
